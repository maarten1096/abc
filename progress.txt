I am currently working on a complete UI overhaul to match the user's request for a ChatGPT-style layout. I have already created the `ProfileMenu` component and am now integrating it into the main layout. I will now refactor the `Sidebar` and `MainArea` components to create the new layout, including a collapsible sidebar, a main content area with a dynamic tool renderer, and a chat input at the bottom. I will also implement a basic theming system and replace the existing emojis with proper icons. I will remove the login requirement for now, and will add it back in later as part of the profile menu. I will also update this file with my progress as I go.
