Okay, from now on create a file called progress and write down what you are doing and if you have compelted it so you never forget. yoiu were working on adding ai logic to flashcards wich is a new tool you were working on. i believe you already added real ai logic to quiz and summary. also i explained how we used ai to note a title, subscribtion, time when created and what tool it was(summary, quiz, flashcard) and put that info into the recents tab in the sidebar, where you can see your recent projects made by your account and view them back, it would be noted like: example: start of ww1(title) then under thaat in smaller letters the tool used, like summary and then the time , like 4h ago or 1d ago. when you make a new quiz or use a different tool you should have the button next to the + with like a import icon. then a search thing pops up where you can describe what you tool was about and ai uses that and compares it to the closest matching describsions the ai made when the quiz in this case was created and shows the results. save this to the new progress file you are gonna make, just like our whole conversation, that progress file is just for you not for the website or something. gl - USER

Okay, I will create a `progress.txt` file to keep track of our conversation and my tasks.

**Current Task:** Add AI logic to the `FlashcardTool`.

**Context:**
- The application has a `QuizTool` and `SummaryTool` that already have AI logic.
- The `recents` feature in the sidebar displays a list of recent projects (summaries, quizzes, flashcards).
- For each recent project, the title, tool used, and time since creation are displayed.
- There is a search functionality that allows users to search for recent projects based on a description. The AI should find the closest matching project.

**Plan:**
1.  **Create `progress.txt` file:** Done.
2.  **Add AI logic to `FlashcardTool.tsx`:** This will likely involve:
    -   Fetching data from the user.
    -   Using the Google Generative AI SDK to generate flashcards.
    -   Saving the flashcards to the database.
    -   Adding a record to the `recents` table.
3.  **Implement the search functionality for recent projects.**

I will now start by examining the `FlashcardTool.tsx` file to understand its current structure.
